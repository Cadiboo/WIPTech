## Setting up a Workspace/Compiling from Source
I'll include how to do this and put the necessary files here soon
# UNTIL I DO THIS
Just set up workspace with the correct version of forge (currently forge-1.12.2-14.23.3.2655) and replace the default /src/ folder with the WIPTech src folder from [here](https://github.com/Cadiboo/WIPTech/tree/master/)

I promise I'll actually write a comprehensive guide on this soon!
