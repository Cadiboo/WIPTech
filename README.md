## Setting up a Workspace/Compiling from Source
I'll include how to do this and put the necessary files here soon
# UNTIL I DO THIS
just set up workspace with the correct version of forge (currently forge-1.12.2-14.23.3.2655) and replace the default /src/ folder with the mods src folder from [here](https://github.com/Cadiboo/WIPTech/tree/master/)

I Promise I'll actually do this soon
